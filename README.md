#Connect-App

Connect - was my final project at Ironhack Berlin. It was built with the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React and Node). Its a FullStack application which is dedicated to all tech lovers in the world.

Its a platform where software developers can upload their projects for future employers to see. Most employers really want to see what you have built with the technologies you claim you know, not just writing it on CV.

This website app was created to solve that problem and bridge the gap between employers and future software developers.

Its also a platform that contains more than 50 tech job websites, this is for developers who are searching for jobs all over the world.

I will improve on its functionalities in due time.
